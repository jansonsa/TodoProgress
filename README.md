# TodoProgress
Todo list app with progress tracker

A Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) pattern was applied to the project.

The app includes a MobileAppService working as the BackEnd and storing all the items. 
It is hosted on Azure, however since no database is being used, the items persist only
till the instance goes down due to inactivity.
